# Generic vagrant box
This [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) box will serve index.html.

You can change variables in the top part of Vagrantfile for different project names, ram usage, and host port.

# Running it
Clone this repo into your project, and run `vagrant up`. Wait for it to provision, and then visit your site at localhost:1337 (unless you changed the port)
